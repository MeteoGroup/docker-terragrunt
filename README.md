# Docker image with all components to easily manage Terraform/Terragrunt infrastructure.
Dockerfile is based on two images made by [cytopia](https://github.com/cytopia).

Those two images are [docker-terragrunt](https://github.com/cytopia/docker-terragrunt/tree/1bc1a2c6de42c6d19f7e91f64f30256c24fd386f) and [docker-terragrunt-fmt](https://github.com/cytopia/docker-terragrunt-fmt/tree/3f8964bea0db043a05d4a8d622f94a07f109b5a7).

Some changes have been applied to add more software to the image - list below.
